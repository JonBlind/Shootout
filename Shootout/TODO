1. Figure out how to centralize Rink.
   THis is a huge problem that needs to be solved. Nearly every class requires a Rink to be passed
   into it for some reason. This is getting tedious, complicates the program, and just makes
   stuff clutter.

2. Finish up MovementManager subclasses
3. Figure out how to implement the goalie crease (either add it to net or make it another class)
4. Figure out logic regarding boundaries of goalie crease and the rink.
