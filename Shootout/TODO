1. Finish up MovementManager subclasses
2. Figure out how to implement the goalie crease (either add it to net or make it another class)
3. Figure out logic regarding boundaries of goalie crease and the rink.
4. Need to create a way in the future to select teams and alter the rink accordingly.


Immediately: Start working on finishing the goalie and skater logic before starting the puck,
             due to how reliant puck movement is on players.
             Create the stick class
             Work on collision with rink and maybe net as well logic.
